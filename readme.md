CTF Writeups
============

- This repository is a collection of CTF boxes, rooms, and challenges that I have solved or am currently working on
- You can find detailed writeups and notes as well as an automated script to retrieve the flag in each respective folder
- Every CTF-specific script references a "config.sh" file within the writeup's directory that you will need to populate with the IP (and port if necessary) of your target machine
    - My config files have been intentionally excluded from this repository
- Please explore the readme files for each room before using the script

#### My notes on tools, services, and techniques can be found here: **[notes.md](docs/notes.md)**
